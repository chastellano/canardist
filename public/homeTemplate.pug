                                        p(class="mt-3") Players are randomly divided into two teams - red and black. No one knows who is on which team, but the black team will always be the majority.
                                        p In each round, a player nominates a specified number of people to play. Everyone votes yes or no if they approve the proposed players.
                                        p If a majority votes no, a new person gets a chance to nominate players for the round. If a majority votes yes, the nominated players each submit a red or black card in a secret ballot.
                                        p Once all players submit, the cards are revealed. If all cards are black, the black team scores a point. If any red cards are submitted, the red team scores a point.
                                        p This completes one round, at which point a new person will nominate players for the next round. The first team to score three points wins.
                                        p The red team is outnumbered. They can only win by successfully convincing the other players they are on the black team. Treachery is encouraged. The ONLY rule is you cannot show anyone your screen (or a screenshot) revealing your identity card.
